    "Anecdotally, you hear in drivers’ ed classes and other places that dawn and dusk are times of increased of accidents.  Is this true? Does accident frequency and severity vary based upon time of day of the accident?  If it does vary, how do the time frames of dawn and dusk compare?  If correlation is in fact identified, then this information, along with additional data such as road and weather conditions, can feed back to automotive engineers, city planners, and safety experts.  They may be able to use this data for improvements to design and planning of roads and also the creation and implantation of additional safety systems on cars in the near future."
